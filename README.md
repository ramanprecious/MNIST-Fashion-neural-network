# MNIST-Fashion-neural-network

In this project, I will try hands-on building of a simple convolutional neural network using pytorch and training it to recognise handwritten digits collated on the MNIST dataset.
Yann Le Cun et al. created the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, which is widely used in computer vision. al. It is made up of pictures of handwritten numbers (0-9), divided into a training set of 50,000 and a test set of 10,000, with each image measuring 28 Ã— 28 pixels in width and height.
This project marks my first step into computer vision and I hope to know more about this seemingly tough topic.
